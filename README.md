# Qno
Qno is a software and hardware solution to eliminate queues in the food industry and beyond. In a typical food store setting, there are two queues, namely the ordering and the collection queue. We aim to eliminate the latter queue using smartphones by appifying the buzzing-square blocks often used by stores usch as Debonaires to alert that the pizza is ready.
Our solution aims to free users from standing around the collection counter awaiting their order number to be called out and give them the freedom to leave or sit somewhere else. Our solution aims to reduce the real estate costs of future food outlet owners by allowing reduction of space around the counter that is currently required to account for the collection queue.
